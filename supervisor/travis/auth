# To set up this file properly, update these three fields:
OWNER="owner" # e.g. paest
REPO="repo"   # e.g. paest-server
TOKEN="token" # https://travis-ci.org/profile/<Your travis account>/profile
# Then do:
# bash supervisor/travis/auth
# The following line will replace this file with the correct content
